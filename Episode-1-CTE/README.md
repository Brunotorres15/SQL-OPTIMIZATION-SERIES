# ‚ö° Part 1 - Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) ‚ö°

### üìå What is a CTE?
*A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a way of naming a result set that can be referenced several times within a single query. It is defined using the WITH clause and exists only during query execution. Although it behaves like a temporary table in the context of the query in which it is used, the CTE does not create a physical table in the database and does not persist after the query has been executed.*

**In this first example, let's compare two queries that fetch the top 10 customers with the highest total order value:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **First Query**: Here, we use a subquery to calculate the total orders per customer and then filter the results. While this works, this approach forces the database to calculate the SUM of orders repeatedly for each customer, which can be quite inefficient, especially in large databases.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Second Query**: In this query, we use a CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate the total orders per customer once before joining it with the customers' table. This significantly reduces the processing load, as the total is calculated only once, and the result is reused.

### üöÄ Why is the second query more performant?

**Reduction of Repetitive Processing**: By calculating the total orders in advance and using a JOIN, the second query avoids recalculating the total orders for each customer.

**Early Filtering**: It applies the filter directly in the CTE, eliminating unnecessary records before the JOIN. This reduces the number of rows processed and improves efficiency.

**Better Use of Indexes**: With the CTE, the database can make better use of indexes (if they exist), making execution faster.

### üìà Conclusion

*Using CTEs can be a powerful technique for optimizing SQL queries, particularly when dealing with complex calculations or large datasets. By reducing repetitive processing and filtering data early, CTEs not only make your queries more readable but can also significantly enhance performance. As you continue to optimize your SQL queries, consider where CTEs might help streamline your logic and boost efficiency.*
